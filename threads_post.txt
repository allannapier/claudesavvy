Just shipped a major update to ClaudeSavvy 🔍

You can now see EXACTLY what Claude Code is doing:

→ Unified Timeline showing all tool calls across all tools
→ Color-coded by type (Read, Write, Bash, Edit, etc.)
→ Click any point to see the actual file path or command
→ Zoomable date range slider for crowded timelines
→ Filter by conversation to trace a specific session

Ever wondered "what files did Claude read?" or "what commands did it run?"

Now you know.

Free & open source: pip install claudesavvy

More deep-dive analytics coming to other pages soon 👀
